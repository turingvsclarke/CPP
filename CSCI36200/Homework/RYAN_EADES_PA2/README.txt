BINARY SEARCH TREE
###############

OVERVIEW
	This program is supposed to create a balanced binary tree out of a given array and then perform operations to output the kth minimal element of the tree. All the functions have been built, but there is an issue with the pointer assignment. The recursion in the constructor somehow ends up assigning pointers incorrectly. I have debugged it several times and will continue to try to get it to work, but right now I have no idea what's wrong. 


EXECUTION
	This program runs in C++ and has been tested in gcc compiler version 4.8.5. To run this program, unzip the package and type "make run" at the command line.
